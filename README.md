## Purpose 

I made this in a couple of hours in class just after learning how to use fetch. I wanted to create a small app for practice and I love beer so this was a no brainer.

## Functionality and Features

This allows you to search for Breweries in the USA by Name, State or City. It hits the Open Brewery API for Results and displays everything you need to know on screen.
